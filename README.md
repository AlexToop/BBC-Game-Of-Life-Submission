# BBC_Game_Of_Life_Submission

Java project that emulates the 'Game of Life' task as specified to candidates. 

Please run project using the following arguments:
  arg1: Game seed - 'random' or 'scenario6'.
  arg2: Iterations to run - Integer (negative values will only display the intial seed)
 
Example run command at out\production\BBC_Game_Of_Life, use "java main.toop.alexander.Main scenario6 2"

Following assumptions were made from the instructions given:
1.	Dead cells do not occupy space on the infinite grid, live cells can later occupy their space as implied by scenario 6.
2.	Scenario 6 game expected outcome is not the same as expected game output, the requirement of an 'infinite' two-dimensional grid would suggest a visual representation of the grid cells themselves may become too visually complex if the live cells are located in very different locations.
